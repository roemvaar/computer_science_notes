# Algorithms and Data Structures

### Baseline of knowledge - Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts

This is a list of must-have knowledge.

**Data Structures:**

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Stacks
- Queues
- Heaps
- Vectors / ArrayLists
- Hash Tables

**Algorithms:**

- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

**Concepts:**

- Divide and conquer
- Bit Manipulation
- Memory (Stack vs Heap)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming 
- Big O Time & Space
- Systems Design

For each of these topics, make sure you understand how to use and implement them and, where applicable
the space and time complexity.

Practice implementing from scratch each of the data structures and algorithms from this list.
