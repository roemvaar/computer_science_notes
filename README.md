# Algorithms and Data Structures

### Baseline of knowledge - Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts

This is a list of must-have knowledge.

**Data Structures:**

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Stacks
- Queues
- Heaps
- Vectors / ArrayLists
- Hash Tables

**Algorithms:**

- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

**Concepts:**

- **Bit Manipulation** - must for embedded software
- **Pointers** 
- Memory (Stack vs Heap)
- Big O Time & Space
- Systems Design
- Divide and conquer
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming

## List of Curated Problems

This is a curated list of problems that are nice to review before and interview.

[Problem Set](./problems.md)

For each of these topics, make sure you understand how to use and implement them and, where applicable
the space and time complexity.

Practice implementing from scratch each of the data structures and algorithms from this list.
