# Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms and data structures implementations from scratch

This project is only used as a personal effort to understand deeply how algorithms
and data structures are implemented and how they work. By no means this project or
should be treated as a professional/reliable implementation of the proposed algorithms
and data structures.

### Baseline of knowledge - Core Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts

This is a list of must-have knowledge 

**Data Structures:**

- Arrays - master pointers in C
- Linked Lists - reverse a linked list, cycles
- Trees, Tries, Graphs
- Stacks & Queues
- Heaps (Binary Heaps/Trees - mins or max heaps - logarithmic)
- Dynamic Arrays - Vectors / ArrayLists - a vector is implemented with an array. When the array hits capacity, the vector
  will create a new array with double the capacity and copy all the elements over to the new array.
- Hash Tables

**Algorithms:**

- Graph Traversal - Breadth-First Search
- Graph Traversal - Depth-First Search
- Binary Search - mid = low + (high - low) / 2; - to avoid overflow
- Sorting - Merge Sort - Run - n*log(n)
- Sorting - Quick Sort - Run - n*log(n)

**Concepts:**

- **Bit Manipulation** - must for embedded software
- Memory (Stack vs Heap)
- Big O Time & Space
- Systems Design
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming

## List of Curated Problems

This is a curated list of problems that are nice to review before and interview.

[Problem Set](./problems.md)

For each of these topics, make sure you understand how to use and implement them and, where applicable
the space and time complexity.

Practice implementing from scratch each of the data structures and algorithms from this list.
