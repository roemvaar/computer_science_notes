JTAG is an industry standard for verifying designs of and testing printed circuit boards after manufacture. JTAG implements standards for on-chip instrumentation in electronic design automation (EDA) as a complementary tool to digital simulation.

JTAG is heavily used as the debugging connection for develpers in embedded systems.
