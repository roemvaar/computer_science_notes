# Scripting

Scripting involves writing small programs, known as scripts, to automate tasks, manipulate files, or perform system administration tasks. Scripts are typically interpreted rather than compiled, making them quick to write, test, and execute.

## Key Characteristics

* **High-Level**: Easy to write and understand.
* **Interpreted**: Scripts are executed line-by-line by an interpreter.
* **Automation-Focused**: Often used to automate repetitive tasks.
* **Platform-Specific or Cross-Platform**: Some scripting languages are tied to specific environments (e.g., PowerShell for Windows), while others are cross-platform (e.g., Python, Bash).
