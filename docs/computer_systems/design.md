# Design Lessons

## Design by Contract

What is a correct program? One that does no more and no less than it claims
to do [2]. A function has some expectations about the system that it runs on:

* Preconditions: It is the caller's responsibility to pass good data (parameters)
* Postconditions: This implies that the function will conclude.
* Class invariants: A class ensures that this condition is always true from the
  perspective of a caller.

If either party fails to live up to the terms of the contract, then a remedy (which was previously agreed to) is invoked—maybe an exception is raised, or the program terminates.

## How can you plan for the kind of architectural volatility demanding to integrate a new technology every now and then? You can’t.

What you can do is make it easy to change. Hide third-party APIs behind your own abstraction layers. Break your code into components: even if you end up deploying them on a single massive server, this approach is a lot easier than taking a monolithic application and splitting it. (We have the scars to
prove it.)

## Avoid global data

In general, your code is easier to understand and maintain if you explicitly pass any
required context into your modules.

* In object-oriented applications, context is often passed as parameters to objects’ constructors. 

* In structured programming (C), you can create structures containing the context and pass around
references to them.

## Data formats

If you have tools that interact between them, connect them with a human-readable format, in this case, people can build a parser to use the data. Instead, if you choose to have a dump of the memory (object file), it will be harder to interact with your system as time passes by. Nowadays, storage is not longer a concern, so take advantage of that and use something like a JSON file.

## Incremental Approach

* A project is never finished: there will always be changes required and functions to add. It is an incremental approach.
* Users get to see something working early
* Start with tracing code - Developers build a structure to work in

## Nest Allocations

The basic pattern for resource allocation can be extended for
routines that need more than one resource at a time.

Deallocate resources in the opposite order to that in which you
allocate them. That way you won’t orphan resources if one resource
contains references to another.

When allocating the same set of resources in different places in
your code, always allocate them in the same order. This will reduce
the possibility of deadlock.
