# Concurrency

**A C++ Tour - Ch. 13**

Concurrency is the execution of several tasks simultaneously.

We call a computation that can potentially be executed concurrently with other
computations a task. A thread is the system-level representation of a task in a
program.

Synchronization:

* Mutex (locks)
* Semaphores

Communication:

* Queues
* Shared-memory
