## Must know concepts

* Abstract Factory
* Adapter
* Composite
* Decorator
* Factory Method
* Observer
* Strategy
* Template Method

Descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.

Describes simple and elegant solutions to specific problems in object-oriented software design. Implementing these patterns represents more work than doing an ad hoc solution, but you gain increased flexibility and reusability. Design patterns are divided into three:

* Creational

* Behavioural

Each pattern has four essential elements:

* Pattern name
* Problem
* Solution
* Consequences

Reuse successful designs by basing new designs on prior experience.
