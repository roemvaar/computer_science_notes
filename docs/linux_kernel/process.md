# Process Management

Another name for a process is a task.

## How does the Linux kernel handle process management?

Linux implements the standard Unix process management APIs such as fork(), exec(), wait(), as well as standard POSIX threads.

The process is the core operating system abstraction. Process is a fundamental and crucial abstraction, at the heart of every modern operating system, and ultimately, we have operating systems altogether to run programs.

Linux stores and represents processes with `task_struct` and `thread_info`. In
Linux, processes are created via `fork()` and ultimately `clone()`.

New executable images are loaded into address space via the `exec()` family of
system calls.

There's a hierarchy of processes. Parents glean information about their deceased
children via the `wait()` family of system calls.

Process ultimately dies forcefully or intentionally via `exit()`.

## Threads

It is often useful for the kernel to perform some operations in the background.

The kernel accomplishes these background operations via kernel threads - the standard processes that exist solely in kernel space.

### What is the difference between threads and processes?

The significant difference between kernel threads and normal processes is that kernel threads do not have an address space. Their `mm` pointer, which points at their address space is NULL.
