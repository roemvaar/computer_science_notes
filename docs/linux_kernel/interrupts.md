# Interrupts

An interrupt is an event that alters the normal execution flow of a program and can be generated by hardware devices or the CPU itself. When an interrupt occurs, the current flow of execution is suspended, and interrupt handlers run. After the interrupt handler runs, the previous execution flow is resumed.

Grouped by source:

* **Synchronous:** generated by executing an instruction and also called exceptions. Divide by zero or a system call are examples of synchronous interrupts.

* **Asynchronous:** generated by an external event. Usually called “interrupts”. These interrupts are external events generated by I/O devices. For example, a network card generates an interrupt to signal that a packet has arrived.

[Interrupt](https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/entry.html#interrupts-and-regular-exceptions) entry and exit handling is slightly more complex than syscalls. If an interrupt is raised while the CPU executes in user space, the entry and exit handling is the same as for syscalls.

It is important to initialize hardware and register an interrupt handler in the proper order to prevent the interrupt handler from running before the device is fully initialized.

## Interrupt Mechanisms

An interrupt mechanism is a way for devices or subsystems to signal the processor when they require immediate attention. It allows the CPU to pause its current task, handle the interrupt, and resume. This model enables modern systems to handle asynchronous events without the CPU continuously polling the devices.

We have three interrupt mechanisms:

* **SoftIRQs:** run immediately in interrupt context.

* **Tasklets:** serve as lower-priority bottom halves for deferred work processing. Tasklets are scheduled and executed in a serialized manner to prevent concurrency issues. Tasklets are being **deprecated**.

* **Workqueues:** run in process context. Workqueues provide a way to handle non-time-critical tasks asynchronously outside interrupt context.

The primary criteria for differentiating the mechanisms are the context in which each runs.
