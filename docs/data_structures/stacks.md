# Stacks

## **1. Overview**

A stack is a data structure that uses the FILO mechanism (First In, Last Out), i.e., you only have access to the last element (top element) inserted into the stack.

* **Use Cases:**
  * To implement the "undo" feature in a text editor, every edition you make is pushed onto a stack. Should you want to undo it, the text editor pops an edition from the stack and reverts it.
  * Stack region of memory: Used for tracking the return addresses, parameters, and local variables for subroutines.
  * Tracking tokens when parsing a programming language.

## **2. Operations and Complexities**

| Operation      | Time Complexity | Notes                                      |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Push           | O(1)            | Add an element to the top of the stack     |
| Pop            | O(1)          | Retrieve and remove the element on top of the stack |
| Top / Peek     | O(1)          |                                              |


More "advanced" stacks may provide more operations to check whether the stack is empty, to get the top element but don't remove it from the stack `top()`, or to get the number of items currently in the stack.

### Stack Implementation - Dynamic Arrays vs Linked Lists:

* Dynamic arrays have random access to memory - which is not a huge advantage in
stacks because you only care about the top element.

* Dynamic arrays may be resized if the stack grows, meaning the elements from the old
array must be copied to the new array. This resizing is a time-consuming operation.

* Linked lists allocate memory dynamically for each new element. Depending on the
overhead of the memory allocator, these allocations are often more time-consuming than
the copies required by a dynamic array.

* Adjacent elements in a dynamic array are adjacent elements in memory, and this may
not be the case for linked lists. Also, a pointer is needed for each element of a
linked list.

* The prior point shows that dynamic arrays have better memory locality, which has big
performance implications as processors are faster than arrays. Usually, an array-based
stack is faster than a linked list.

* Conversely, a linked list is easier to implement than a dynamic array.
