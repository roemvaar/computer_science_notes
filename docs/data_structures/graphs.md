## Graphs

Graphs are important â€” more than you think. Even if you already think they're
important, it's more than you think.

There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list), and you should familiarize yourself
with each representation and its pros and cons.

You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and
depth-first search. You should know their computational complexity,
their tradeoffs and how to implement them in real code.

If possible, try to study fancier algorithms, such as Dijkstra and A*. They're great
for just about anything, from game programming to distributed computing, to you name
it. You should know them.

Whenever someone gives you a problem, think of graphs. They are the most fundamental
and flexible way of representing any relationship, so it's about a 50-50 shot that any
interesting design problem has a graph involved in it. Make sure you can't think of a
way to solve it using graphs before moving on to other solution types. This tip is
important!

Graphs are flexible data structures that use nodes and edges to store information.

### Find a node in a Graph

If the graph's structure offers no navigation help, you must visit every node until you find the one you want. There are two approaches to achieve this:

* **Depth First Search (DFS):** searching a graph via DFS, we keep following edges
going deeper and deeper into the graph. When you reach a node with no edges to any
new nodes, you return to the previous node and continue the process.

* **Breadth First Search (BFS)**
