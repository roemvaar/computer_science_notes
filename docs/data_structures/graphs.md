# Graphs

## **1. Overview**

Graphs are flexible data structures that use nodes and edges to store information. A graph is a collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them.

Graphs can be either directed or undirected. While directed edges are like a one-way street, undirected edges are like a two-way street.

A graph might consist of multiple isolated subgraphs. If there is a path between every pair of vertices, it is called a "connected graph".

A graph can also have cycles (or not). An **acyclic graph** is one without cycles.

* **Use Cases:** 
  * Example: Efficient searching and sorting (e.g., database indexing).
  * Example: Suitable for priority-based tasks (e.g., heaps for priority queues).

| Operation      | Time Complexity | Notes                                      |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Depth-First Search (DFS)         | O(V + E)          | V is the number of vertices. E is the number of edges |
| Breadth-First Search (BFS)         | O(V + E)          |                      |


Graphs are important â€” more than you think. Even if you already think they're important, it's more than you think.

A tree is a connected graph without cycles, i.e., a type of graph, but not all graphs are trees.

You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. You should know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs and how to implement them in real code.

If possible, try to study fancier algorithms, such as Dijkstra and A*. They're great for just about anything, from game programming to distributed computing, to you name it. You should know them.

Whenever someone gives you a problem, think of graphs. They are the most fundamental and flexible way of representing any relationship, so it's about a 50-50 shot that any interesting design problem has a graph involved in it. Make sure you can't think of a way to solve it using graphs before moving on to other solution types. This tip is important!

## Representing a Graph

There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, adjacency matrix, and adjacency list), and you should familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros and cons.

### Adjacency List

This is the most common way to represent a graph. Every vertex (node) stores a list of adjacent vertices. In an undirected graph, an edge like (a, b) would be stored twice: once in a's adjacent vertices and once in b's adjacent vertices.

A simple class definition for a graph node could look essentially the same as a tree node.

```java
class Graph {
    public Node[] nodes;
}

class Node {
    public String name;
    public Node[] children;
}
```

The `Graph` class is used because, unlike in a tree, you can't necessarily reach all the nodes from a single node.

### Adjacency Matrix

An adjacency matrix is an NxN boolean matrix (where N is the number of nodes), where a true value at matrix[i][j] indicates an edge from node i to node j. You can also use an integer matrix with 0s and 1s.

In an nudirected graph, an adjacency matrix will be symmetric. In a directed graph, it will not (necessarily) be symmetric.

## **4. Important Techniques**

* Ensure you are correctly keeping track of visited nodes and not visiting each node more than once. Otherwise your code could end up in an infinite loop.

## Graph Search

If the graph's structure offers no navigation help, you must visit every node until you find the one you want. The two most common ways to search a graph are depth-first search and breadth-first search.

* **Depth First Search (DFS):** searching a graph via DFS, we keep following edges going deeper and deeper into the graph. When you reach a node with no edges to any new nodes, you return to the previous node and continue the process.

More information [here](https://roemvaar.github.io/computer_science_notes/docs/algorithms/dfs.html).

```python
def dfs(matrix):
    # Check for an empty matrix/graph
    if not matrix:
        return []
    
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    visited = set()
    directions = ((0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0))

    def traverse(i, j):
        if (i, j) in visited:
            return
        
        visited.add((i, j))
        # Traverse neighbors
        for direction in directions:
            next_i, next_j = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
            if 0 <= next_i < rows and 0 <= next_j <= cols:
                # Add in question-specific checks, where relevant
                traverse(next_i, next_j)
        
    for i in range(cols):
        for j in range(cols):
            traverse(i, j)
```

* **Breadth First Search (BFS):** starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

```python
from collections import dequeue

def bfs(matrix):
    # Check for an empty matrix/graph
    if not matrix:
        return []
    
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    visited = set()
    directions = ((0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0))     # right, left, up, down

    def traverse(i, j):
        queue = dequeue([(i, j)])
        while queue:
            curr_i, curr_j = queue.popleft()
            if (curr_i, curr_j) not in visited:
                visited.add((curr_i, curr_j))
                # Traverse neighbors
                for direction in directions:
                    next_i, next_j = curr_i + direction[0], curr_j + direction[1]
                    if 0 <= next_i < rows and 0 <= next_j < cols:
                        # Add in question-specific checks, where relevant
                        queue.append((next_i, next_j))
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            traverse(i, j)S
```

## DFS vs BFS

Breadth-first search and depth-first search tend to be used in different scenarios. DFS is often preferred if we want to visit every node in the graph.

If we want to find the **shortest path** (or just any path) between two nodes, BFS is generally better.

## Shortest-Path

* Dijkstra
