# Strings

## **1. Overview**

Strings are used for storing text. A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes. Strings are written in between `" "`.

Strings are immutable (unchangeable) objects.

In Python, you can't add a new character at the end of a string, instead you have to create a new string, copy the elements of the original string and append the character to the end of the new string. This will take O(n).

* **Use Cases:** 
  * Example: Efficient searching and sorting (e.g., database indexing).
  * Example: Suitable for priority-based tasks (e.g., heaps for priority queues).

## **2. Operations and Complexities**

| Operation      | Time Complexity | Notes                                      |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Search         | O(n)          | Linear search, i.e., you have to go through all the elements of the strin|
| Insertion         | O(...)          | Special cases (e.g., balanced or unbalanced)|
| Deletion         | O(...)          |                                            |

Indexing is constant time.
