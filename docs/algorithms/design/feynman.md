# Feynman Algorithm

Richard Feynman's problem-solving technique, also known as the Feynman Algorithm, involves a few steps:

1. **Write down the problem** 
Clearly define the problem in simple language. This helps to identify gaps in your understanding.

2. **Ask questions**
Start by asking basic questions, like "What is the simplest example?" or "How can you tell if the answer is right?"

3. **Reduce the problem**
Ask questions until you've reduced the problem to an essential problem that you can think you can solve.

4. **Think hard**
Think about the problem and trade off different solutions until you find one.

5. **Write down the solution**

In short, "The Feynman Problem Solving Algorithm" consists of the following three steps:

1. Write down the problem.
2. Think very hard.
3. Write down the solution.

Or just be smart.
