# Feynman Algorithm

Richard Feynman's problem-solving technique, also known as the Feynman Algorithm, involves a few steps:

1. Write down the problem

Clearly define the problem in simple language. This helps to identify gaps in your understanding.

2. Ask questions

Start by asking basic questions, like "What is the simplest example?" or "How can you tell if the answer is right?"

3. Reduce the problem

Ask questions until you've reduced the problem to an essential problem that you can think you can solve.

4. Think hard

Think about the problem and trade off different solutions until you find one.

5. Write down the solution
