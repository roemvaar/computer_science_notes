# Sorting

<!-- ## The sorting problem -->

<!-- Focus: Understand the divide-and-conquer approach and time complexity -->

Insertion sort usually runs faster than merge sort for small input sizes; once the input size n becomes large enough, merge sort's advantage of `log n` versus `n` compensates for the difference in constant factors [CLRS, p. 12].

You need to know how to sort. You should know the details of at least one `n log (n)` sorting algorithm. You must know merge sort and quick sort. Don't use bubble-sort.
