# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

In **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, you start with the root, move left to right across the second level, then move left to right across the third level, and so forth. You continue the search until either you have examined all the nodes or you find the node
you are searching for.

BFS traverses the nodes level by level.
