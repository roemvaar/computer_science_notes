# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a tree and graph traversal algorithm. DFS
visit the nodes in the three or graphs.

A DFS follows one branch of the tree down as many levels as
possible until the target node is found or the end is reached.

When the search can't go down any further, it is continued at the
the nearest ancestor with unexplored children.
