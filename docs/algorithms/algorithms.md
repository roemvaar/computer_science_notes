# Algorithms

Here is a list of the most important algorithms every software engineer should be familiar with.

<!--
## Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms optimize locally, hoping to end up with a global optimum. Greedy algorithms are easy to write and fast to run, so
thy make good approximation algorithms.

NP-Complete problems have no known fast solution. If you have an NP-Complete problem, your best bet is to use an approximation algorithm.
