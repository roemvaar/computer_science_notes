# One Stop Shop - Embedded Software Engineer

This is a list of resources that I consider are "must" knowledge for
aspiring or newbies embedded software engineers, and will make your
life easier when collaborating with others:

* C Programming Language - 
* C++ - Udacity C++ for Programmers
* Git - [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (Ch.)
* Bash -
* Vim - 

** Note: This blog entry only points to resources that can
rapidly help you to grasp some concepts, but it's by no means an 
in-depth guide.
