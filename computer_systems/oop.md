# Object Oriented Programming

Things to have in mind:

- Where possible, always use accessor functions to read and write the attributes of objects

- All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether
they are implemented through storage or through computation.

## Inheritance

## Encapsulation

## Polymorphism

## Data Abstraction
