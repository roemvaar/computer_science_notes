# Object Oriented Programming

Things to have in mind:

- Where possible, always use accessor functions to read and write the attributes of objects

- All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether
they are implemented through storage or through computation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* What's a virtual function?

TODO: Polymorphism

A virtual function is a member function that you expect to be redefined in derived classes.

Use virtual functions instead of a constructor in order to make a program more flexible, i.e., you can change the classes that get instantiated by making a subclass of the base class and redefining those virtual functions.
