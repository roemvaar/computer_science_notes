# Problems

**Must study problems:**
 
 ## Linked Lists
 
- Reverse a linked list
- Check if a linked list is acyclic - slow and fast pointers
- Linked List Flattening/Unflattening (multi-level, PIE)
- Implement the Linked List Push and Pop functions.
Hint: Take care of pointer to pointer struct. Nodes to be created in memory with dynamic memory allocation.
 
 ## Arrays
 
- Rotate an image - https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/solution/
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
- Count and Say
- Design a stack (linked list vs arrays/vectors)

## Strings

- Camel Case 4 - HackerRank

 ## Bit Manipulation

- Hamming Distance (and Number of 1 Bits)
- Operations using shifts - e.g. power of 2 - left shift+
- isPowerOfTwo / isPowerOfFour
- isUnique
- Rotate image - using bit manipulation (1 bit = 1 pixel)
- Write an algorithm to reverse the bits of an UNSIGNED binary number
 
 ## Trees

- Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
- Invert a binary tree
